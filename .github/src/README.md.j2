Follow this guide to self-host the {{metadata['description']}} model with BentoCloud in your own cloud account. If your team doesnâ€™t already have access to BentoCloud, please use the link below to contact us and set it up in your cloud environment.

[![Deploy on BentoCloud](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy_on_BentoCloud-d0bfff?style=for-the-badge)](https://cloud.bentoml.com/)
[![Talk to sales](https://img.shields.io/badge/Talk_to_sales-eefbe4?style=for-the-badge)](https://bentoml.com/contact)

See [here](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/examples/overview.html) for a full list of BentoML example projects.

{%- else %}

This is a BentoML example project, showing you how to serve and deploy {{metadata['description']}} using [vLLM](https://vllm.ai), a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference engine.

See [here](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/examples/overview.html) for a full list of BentoML example projects.

ðŸ’¡ This example is served as a basis for advanced code customization, such as custom model, inference logic or vLLM options. For simple LLM hosting with OpenAI compatible endpoint without writing any code, see [OpenLLM](https://github.com/bentoml/OpenLLM).

{%- endif %}

## Prerequisites

{%- if requires_hf_tokens | lower == "true" %}
- You have gained access to `{{model_id}}` on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/{{model_id}}).
{%- endif %}
- If you want to test the Service locally, we recommend you use {{metadata['gpu_recommendation']}}

## Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bentoml/BentoVLLM.git
cd BentoVLLM/{{model_name}}

# Recommend Python 3.11
pip install -r requirements.txt

# if you are running locally, we recommend install additional flashinfer library for better performance.
pip install flashinfer-python --extra-index-url https://flashinfer.ai/whl/cu124/torch2.6

{%- if requires_hf_tokens | lower == "true" %}

export HF_TOKEN=<your-api-key>
{%- endif %}
```

## Run the BentoML Service

We have defined a BentoML Service in `service.py`. To run the service do the following:

```python
$ bentoml serve service.py:VLLM
```

The server is now active at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You can interact with it using the Swagger UI or in other different ways.

> [!NOTE]
> This ships with a default `max_model_len={{engine_config['max_model_len']}}`. If you wish to change this value, set `MAX_MODEL_LEN=<target_context_len>`. Make sure that you have enough VRAM to use this context length. BentoVLLM will only set a conservative value based on this model configuration.

<summary>OpenAI-compatible endpoints</summary>

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:3000/v1', api_key='na')

# Use the following func to get the available models
client.models.list()

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="{{model_id}}",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Who are you? Please respond in pirate speak!"
        }
    ],
    stream=True,
)
for chunk in chat_completion:
    # Extract and print the content of the model's reply
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")
```

These OpenAI-compatible endpoints also support [vLLM extra parameters](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/openai_compatible_server.html#extra-parameters). For example, you can force the chat completion output a JSON object by using the `guided_json` parameters:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:3000/v1', api_key='na')

# Use the following func to get the available models
client.models.list()

json_schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "city": {"type": "string"}
    }
}

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="{{model_id}}",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is the capital of France?"
        }
    ],
    extra_body=dict(guided_json=json_schema),
)
print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)  # will return something like: {"city": "Paris"}
```

{%- if reasoning | lower == "true" %}

> [!NOTE]
> This is also a reasoning model. Structured Outputs might not work if you enable reasoning! Please check upstream vLLM for support on this use-case.

{%- endif %}

All supported extra parameters are listed in [vLLM documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/openai_compatible_server.html#extra-parameters).

**Note**: If your Service is deployed with [protected endpoints on BentoCloud](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/bentocloud/how-tos/manage-access-token.html#access-protected-deployments), you need to set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your BentoCloud API key first.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY={YOUR_BENTOCLOUD_API_TOKEN}
```

You can then use the following line to replace the client in the above code snippet. Refer to [Obtain the endpoint URL](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/bentocloud/how-tos/call-deployment-endpoints.html#obtain-the-endpoint-url) to retrieve the endpoint URL.

```python
client = OpenAI(base_url='your_bentocloud_deployment_endpoint_url/v1')
```

For detailed explanations of the Service code, see [vLLM inference](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/examples/vllm.html).

## Deploy to BentoCloud

After the Service is ready, you can deploy the application to BentoCloud for better management and scalability. [Sign up](https://www.bentoml.com/) if you haven't got a BentoCloud account.

Make sure you have [logged in to BentoCloud](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/scale-with-bentocloud/manage-api-tokens.html).

```bash
bentoml cloud login
```

{%- if requires_hf_tokens | lower == "true" %}

Create a BentoCloud secret to store the required environment variable and reference it for deployment.

```bash
bentoml secret create huggingface HF_TOKEN=$HF_TOKEN

bentoml deploy service:VLLM --secret huggingface
```
{%- else %}

Create a BentoCloud deployment from this service:

```bash
bentoml deploy service:VLLM
```
{%- endif %}

Once the application is up and running on BentoCloud, you can access it via the exposed URL.

**Note**: For custom deployment in your own infrastructure, use [BentoML to generate an OCI-compliant image](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/get-started/packaging-for-deployment.html).
