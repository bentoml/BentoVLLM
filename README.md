This is a BentoML example project, showing you how to serve and deploy open-source Large Language Models using [vLLM](https://vllm.ai), a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference engine.

See [here](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-what-you-can-build-with-bentoml) for a full list of BentoML example projects.

ðŸ’¡ This example is served as a basis for advanced code customization, such as custom model, inference logic or vLLM options. For simple LLM hosting with OpenAI compatible endpoint without writing any code, see [OpenLLM](https://github.com/bentoml/OpenLLM).


## Prerequisites

- You have installed Python 3.8+ and `pip`. See the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to learn more.
- You have a basic understanding of key concepts in BentoML, such as Services. We recommend you read [Quickstart](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/1.2/get-started/quickstart.html) first.
- This example Service uses the model ``meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf``. You can choose any other model supported by vLLM based on your needs. If you are using the same model in the project, you need to obtain access to it on the [Meta website](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf).
- If you want to test the Service locally, you need a Nvidia GPU with at least 16G VRAM.
- (Optional) We recommend you create a virtual environment for dependency isolation for this project. See the [Conda documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for details.

## Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bentoml/BentoVLLM.git
cd BentoVLLM
pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -f -U "pydantic>=2.0"
```

## Run the BentoML Service

We have defined a BentoML Service in `service.py`. RunÂ `bentomlÂ serve`Â in your project directory to start the Service.

```python
$ bentoml serve .

2024-01-18T07:51:30+0800 [INFO] [cli] Starting production HTTP BentoServer from "service:VLLMService" listening on http://localhost:3000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO 01-18 07:51:40 model_runner.py:501] Capturing the model for CUDA graphs. This may lead to unexpected consequences if the model is not static. To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI.
INFO 01-18 07:51:40 model_runner.py:505] CUDA graphs can take additional 1~3 GiB memory per GPU. If you are running out of memory, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or enforcing eager mode.
INFO 01-18 07:51:46 model_runner.py:547] Graph capturing finished in 6 secs.
```

The server is now active atÂ [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You can interact with it using the Swagger UI or in other different ways.

CURL

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:3000/generate' \
  -H 'accept: text/event-stream' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "prompt": "Explain superconductors like I'\''m five years old",
  "tokens": null
}'
```

Python client

```python
import bentoml

with bentoml.SyncHTTPClient("http://localhost:3000") as client:
    response_generator = client.generate(
        prompt="Explain superconductors like I'm five years old",
        tokens=None
    )
    for response in response_generator:
        print(response)
```

For detailed explanations of the Service code, see [vLLM inference](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/use-cases/large-language-models/vllm.html).

## Deploy to BentoCloud

After the Service is ready, you can deploy the application to BentoCloud for better management and scalability. [Sign up](https://www.bentoml.com/) if you haven't got a BentoCloud account.

Make sure you have [logged in to BentoCloud](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/bentocloud/how-tos/manage-access-token.html), set your Hugging Face access token in ``bentofile.yaml``, then run the following command to deploy it.

```bash
bentoml deploy .
```

Once the application is up and running on BentoCloud, you can access it via the exposed URL.

**Note**: For custom deployment in your own infrastructure, use [BentoML to generate an OCI-compliant image](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/guides/containerization.html).
