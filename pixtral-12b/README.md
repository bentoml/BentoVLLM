</div>

This is a BentoML example project, showing you how to serve and deploy Pixtral 12B using [vLLM](https://vllm.ai), a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference engine.

See [here](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-what-you-can-build-with-bentoml) for a full list of BentoML example projects.

ðŸ’¡ This example is served as a basis for advanced code customization, such as custom model, inference logic or vLLM options. For simple LLM hosting with OpenAI compatible endpoint without writing any code, see [OpenLLM](https://github.com/bentoml/OpenLLM).


## Prerequisites

If you want to test the Service locally, we recommend you use a Nvidia GPU with at least 16G VRAM.

## Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bentoml/BentoVLLM.git
cd BentoVLLM/pixtral-12b

# Recommend Python 3.11
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the BentoML Service

We have defined a BentoML Service in `service.py`. RunÂ `bentomlÂ serve`Â in your project directory to start the Service.

```python
$ bentoml serve .

2024-01-18T07:51:30+0800 [INFO] [cli] Starting production HTTP BentoServer from "service:VLLM" listening on http://localhost:3000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO 01-18 07:51:40 model_runner.py:501] Capturing the model for CUDA graphs. This may lead to unexpected consequences if the model is not static. To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI.
INFO 01-18 07:51:40 model_runner.py:505] CUDA graphs can take additional 1~3 GiB memory per GPU. If you are running out of memory, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or enforcing eager mode.
INFO 01-18 07:51:46 model_runner.py:547] Graph capturing finished in 6 secs.
```

The server is now active atÂ [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You can interact with it using the Swagger UI or in other different ways.

## Deploy to BentoCloud

After the Service is ready, you can deploy the application to BentoCloud for better management and scalability. [Sign up](https://www.bentoml.com/) if you haven't got a BentoCloud account.

Make sure you have [logged in to BentoCloud](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/bentocloud/how-tos/manage-access-token.html), then run the following command to deploy it.

```bash
bentoml deploy .
```

Once the application is up and running on BentoCloud, you can access it via the exposed URL.

**Note**: For custom deployment in your own infrastructure, use [BentoML to generate an OCI-compliant image](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/guides/containerization.html).
